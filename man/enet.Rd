\arguments{
\item{xtrain}{nxp matrix - training dataset}

\item{ytrain}{factor - response variable}

\item{alpha}{= 1 (lasso), alpha = 0 (ridge), 0 < alpha < 1 (elastic net penalty)}

\item{lambda}{= strength of elastic net penalty}

\item{family}{"binomial" or "multinomial"}

\item{xtest}{nxp matrx  - test dataset}

\item{ytest}{factor - response variable}

\item{filter}{= "none" or "p.value"}

\item{topranked}{= 50 (top number of features to select and build a classifier)}

\item{keepVar}{- names of specific variable to keep in model}

\item{weights}{- observational weights; default to 1}
